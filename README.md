The objective of this challenge is to classify the disease status of a plant 
given an image of a passion fruit. You need to classify each fruit individually 
and not assume that all the fruit in the same image have the same status. 


## Input dataset
The dataset contains about 4000 images resized to 512x512. There are ~5000 fruit in total. 
Some images contain more than one fruit and thus more than one bounding box. 
The images are annotated using bounding boxes defined in a COCO format and each bounding box is 
tagged to one of three classes: fruit_healthy, fruit_brownspot and fruit_woodiness.
