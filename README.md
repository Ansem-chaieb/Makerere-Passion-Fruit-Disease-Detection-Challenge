# Makerere-Passion-Fruit-Disease-Detection-Challenge
Passion fruit pests and diseases in Uganda lead to reduced yields and decreased investment in farming over time. Most Ugandan farmers (including passion fruit farmers) are smallholder farmers from low-income households, and do not have sufficient information and means to combat these challenges. Without the required knowledge about the health of their crops, farmers cannot intervene promptly to avoid devastating losses.
